/*  If an even numbr of people stand in a circle and get numbered clockwise, everyone is facing someone else
through the centre of the circle i.e. opposite to the prior. 

This program will output the 'number' of the person who is being looked at by 'c' if 'a' is looking at 'b'.
But in some cases it is not possible. It will output "-1" in those cases.  */
